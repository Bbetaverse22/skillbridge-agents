# ✅ Tab-Aware Routing Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

You now have **tab-aware routing** that connects your UI tabs to the coordinator's agent selection!

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Dashboard Component** (`components/skillbridge/skillbridge-dashboard.tsx`)
- Passes `activeTab` and `onSuggestTab` to ChatAssistant
- ChatAssistant now knows which tab the user is on

#### 2. **Chat Assistant** (`components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx`)
- Receives `activeTab` and `onSuggestTab` props
- Includes `tabContext` in message metadata
- Shows visual badge indicating which agent is responding
- Helper functions to map agents to display names
- (Optional) Auto-navigation support (currently disabled)

#### 3. **API Route** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Extracts `tabContext` from message metadata
- Passes tabContext to coordinator for routing

#### 4. **Coordinator** (`lib/agents/coordinator.ts`)
- Updated `UserContext` interface to include `tabContext`
- Tab-aware routing logic with fallback priorities:
  1. **Strong content matches** (e.g., GitHub URLs) take precedence
  2. **Tab context** used when no strong content match
  3. **Default** to coordinator for general queries

## How It Works Now

### Example Flow

```
User on "gaps" tab → Types "What should I learn?"
↓
ChatAssistant includes metadata: { tabContext: "gaps" }
↓
API extracts tabContext from message
↓
Coordinator sees: query="What should I learn?" + tabContext="gaps"
↓
Routes to: gap_agent (biased by tab context)
↓
Response shows badge: "📊 Skill Analyzer"
```

### Routing Priority

1. **Explicit Content Match** (Highest Priority)
   - GitHub URLs → gap_agent
   - "github user X" → github_agent
   - "learn" keywords → learning_agent
   - "career" keywords → career_agent
   - "progress" keywords → progress_agent

2. **Tab Context Bias** (Medium Priority)
   - User on "gaps" tab → prefers gap_agent
   - User on "learning" tab → prefers learning_agent
   - User on "career" tab → prefers career_agent
   - User on "progress" tab → prefers progress_agent

3. **Default** (Lowest Priority)
   - Falls back to coordinator for general queries

### Visual Indicators

Every assistant response now shows which agent responded:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 📊 Skill Analyzer          │  ← Agent badge
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Based on your GitHub repo...│
│                             │
│ Skills Found:               │
│ - TypeScript                │
│ - React                     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Agent badges:
- `📊 Skill Analyzer` - gap_agent
- `🐙 GitHub Expert` - github_agent
- `📚 Learning Guide` - learning_agent
- `💼 Career Coach` - career_agent
- `📈 Progress Tracker` - progress_agent
- `🤖 Assistant` - coordinator

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Tab Context Routing

```
User on "learning" tab
User: "Help me improve"

→ Routes to learning_agent (because of tab context)
→ Shows "📚 Learning Guide" badge
→ Provides learning path recommendations
```

### Example 2: Content Overrides Tab

```
User on "career" tab
User: "Analyze https://github.com/facebook/react"

→ Routes to gap_agent (GitHub URL has priority)
→ Shows "📊 Skill Analyzer" badge
→ Analyzes repository for skills
```

### Example 3: Explicit Query

```
User on "gaps" tab
User: "What are my career options?"

→ Routes to career_agent (career keyword)
→ Shows "💼 Career Coach" badge
→ Provides career advice
```

## Configuration

### Enable Auto-Navigation

To automatically navigate users to the relevant tab based on agent responses:

```typescript
// components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx
// Line 100: Uncomment this line
onSuggestTab(suggestedTab);
```

### Customize Agent Display Names

```typescript
// components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx
const agentNames: Record<string, string> = {
  'gap_agent': '📊 Skill Analyzer',  // Customize these
  'github_agent': '🐙 GitHub Expert',
  // ... add more
};
```

### Adjust Routing Priority

```typescript
// lib/agents/coordinator.ts
// Modify the routing logic to change priorities
```

## Testing

Try these queries from different tabs:

### On "Skill Analysis" (gaps) Tab:
- ✅ "What skills do I need?" → gap_agent
- ✅ "Analyze github.com/X/Y" → gap_agent
- ✅ "Help me learn" → learning_agent (content override)

### On "Learning" Tab:
- ✅ "Create a learning path" → learning_agent
- ✅ "What should I study?" → learning_agent
- ✅ "Show my progress" → progress_agent (content override)

### On "Career" Tab:
- ✅ "Build my resume" → career_agent
- ✅ "Career advice" → career_agent
- ✅ "Analyze my skills" → gap_agent (content override)

### On "Chat" Tab (No Tab Bias):
- ✅ Pure content-based routing
- ✅ Coordinator handles general queries

## Debug Logging

The console shows routing decisions:

```
=== API ROUTE CALLED ===
Messages received: 2
Tab context: gaps
Using tab-suggested agent: gap_agent (from tab: gaps)
```

## Benefits

1. **Context-Aware**: System knows where user is working
2. **Smart Routing**: Content matches override tab context when needed
3. **Visual Feedback**: Users see which expert is helping them
4. **Flexible**: Easy to customize routing priorities
5. **Progressive**: Works even without tab context

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Tab Navigation Hints**: Add buttons like "View in Skill Analysis →"
2. **Tab-Specific Prompts**: Show different example queries per tab
3. **Agent Switching**: Allow users to manually select agent
4. **Agent History**: Show which agents handled each conversation
5. **Tab Recommendations**: Suggest tabs based on query type

## Files Modified

- ✅ `components/skillbridge/skillbridge-dashboard.tsx`
- ✅ `components/chat/chat-assistant.tsx`
- ✅ `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- ✅ `lib/agents/coordinator.ts`

All changes are backward compatible and won't break existing functionality!
