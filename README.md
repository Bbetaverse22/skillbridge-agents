- **Progress Tab**: Track your learning progress
- **Chat Tab**: Multi-agent chat with intelligent routing

### Interactive Demo
Visit `/demo` to test the sanitizer with pre-built examples:
- API Keys (OpenAI, AWS, GitHub)
- Database connection strings
- Personal information (SSN, email, phone)
- Credit card numbers
- JWT tokens

### Multi-Agent Testing
Try these examples in the chat to see different agents in action:

**GitHub Repository Analysis (Gap Agent):**
```
Analyze this GitHub repo for skills: https://github.com/user/repo
What technologies are used in this codebase?
```

**Learning Path Generation (Learning Agent):**
```
Create a learning path for becoming a React developer
What should I study to learn machine learning?
```

**Career Development (Career Agent):**
```
Help me optimize my resume for a frontend developer position
Find open source projects I can contribute to
```

**Progress Tracking (Progress Agent):**
```
Show me my learning progress
What skills have I improved this month?
```

### Security Testing
Test the sanitizer with sensitive data:
```
My API key is sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
Database: mongodb://user:password123@localhost:27017/mydb
Contact: john.doe@example.com, Phone: (555) 123-4567
```

## üîß Configuration

### Multi-Agent System
```typescript
// Coordinator Agent routes queries to specialized agents
const coordinator = new CoordinatorAgent();
const routedAgent = coordinator.routeQuery(userQuery, context);

// Available agents:
// - coordinator: General queries and orchestration
// - gap_agent: Skill gap analysis and GitHub repo analysis
// - learning_agent: Personalized learning paths
// - career_agent: Resume optimization and job search
// - progress_agent: Learning analytics and tracking
```
