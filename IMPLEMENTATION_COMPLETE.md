- Technologies used

#### **Column 2: Skill Gap Report**
- Overall skill score (percentage)
- Top 5 skill gaps with visual bars
- Priority indicators (high/medium/low)
- Current vs Target levels
- Integrated Skill Radar Chart

#### **Column 3: Recommendations**
- Personalized recommendations
- Color-coded priority levels
- Learning path steps
- "View Full Learning Path" button

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Step 1: Navigate to Skill Analysis Tab**
Open http://localhost:3000 and click on the "Skill Analysis" tab

### **Step 2: Enter GitHub Repository URL**
Example:
```
https://github.com/facebook/react
https://github.com/vercel/next.js
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
```

### **Step 3: Click "Analyze" or Press Enter**
Watch the progress bar as the system:
1. Fetches repository data
2. Analyzes skills and technologies
3. Stores results on server
4. Displays comprehensive report

### **Step 4: Review Results**
Three columns show:
- **GitHub data**: Technologies, languages, frameworks
- **Skill gaps**: What you're missing and priorities
- **Recommendations**: Personalized learning advice

### **Step 5: Access in Chat**
Go to the "Assistant" tab and ask:
```
"What were my skill assessment results?"
"What should I learn based on my GitHub analysis?"
"Tell me about my skill gaps"
```

## 📊 Real Example Test

Try these repositories to see different skill profiles:

### **Beginner Project**
```
https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter
```
- Should show: TypeScript, Node.js, Express basics
- Gaps: Advanced patterns, testing, deployment

### **Intermediate Project**
```
https://github.com/nestjs/nest
```
- Should show: TypeScript, NestJS, Design patterns
- Gaps: Microservices, advanced architecture

### **Advanced Project**
```
https://github.com/vercel/next.js
```
- Should show: React, Next.js, Advanced TypeScript
- Gaps: Contribution patterns, open-source workflows

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Files Changed**
1. ✅ `components/skillbridge/skillbridge-dashboard.tsx` - Switched to new component
2. ✅ `components/skillbridge/redesigned-skill-assessment.tsx` - Fully wired with real data

### **API Integration**
- **Input**: GitHub repository URL
- **Processing**: `GapAnalyzerAgent.analyzeGitHubRepository()`
- **Storage**: POST `/api/skill-gaps` with userId and results
- **Retrieval**: Chat agent uses `get_skill_gap_analysis` tool

### **Data Flow**
```
User enters URL
    ↓
Parse & validate GitHub URL
    ↓
GapAnalyzerAgent fetches & analyzes
    ↓
Results stored in skillGapStorage (server)
    ↓
Display 3-column results with charts
    ↓
Chat agent can access stored data
```

## 🎯 What's Next (TODO)

### ⏳ **Pending Tasks**

#### 1. **Move AI Chat Analysis to Chat Tab** (Phase 2)
- Add "Upload Transcript" button in Chat tab
- Integrate `AIChatAnalysis` component
- Allow users to upload `.txt` or `.md` files
- Results feed into chat context

#### 2. **GitHub Profile Analysis** (Future)
- Currently shows "Coming Soon"
- Would aggregate all user repositories
- Show comprehensive skill profile
- Compare with job requirements

#### 3. **Repository Search** (Future)
- Search GitHub for repos by technology
- Analyze trending repos
- Compare your skills with popular projects

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### **Current**
- ⚠️ GitHub Profile Analysis not yet implemented (shows placeholder)
- ⚠️ Advanced Options section shows "Coming Soon" for most features
- ⚠️ AI Chat Analysis still in old location (needs migration)

### **Future Enhancements**
- Historical tracking (save multiple analyses over time)
- Export reports as PDF
- Compare multiple repositories
- Team/organization analysis
