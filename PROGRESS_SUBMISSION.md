## üéØ Project Overview

SkillBridge.ai is an **agentic AI platform** that helps developers identify skill gaps and improve their portfolios through autonomous actions. Unlike traditional AI that just generates reports, SkillBridge.ai **takes action**: analyzing GitHub profiles, researching learning resources, creating improvement tasks, and tracking progress.

## üí° Key Learnings & Decisions

### What Went Well
- **LangGraph Platform** provides excellent visual debugging for agents
- **Prisma Postgres** setup was smooth with Vercel integration
- **Type safety** from database to frontend catches errors early
- **Modular architecture** makes it easy to add new agents

### Technical Decisions
1. **LangGraph over custom solution**: Better state management and visual debugging
2. **Prisma Postgres over Vercel Postgres**: Better free tier limits (5GB vs 256MB)
3. **NextAuth.js for OAuth**: Industry standard with great GitHub integration
4. **Placeholder approach**: Working infrastructure before real implementation

### Challenges Overcome
- Prisma Studio connectivity issues (non-blocking - app works fine)
- LangGraph TypeScript strict typing (resolved with proper type definitions)
- Environment variable management across Vercel CLI and dashboard
