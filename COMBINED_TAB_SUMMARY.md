## 💡 Butterfly Effect Connection

### **Your Inspiration:**

You loved the Butterfly Tracker's probabilistic simulation:
```
Tweet → 60% trending → 30% moderate → 10% backfire
```

### **Career Adaptation:**

```
Current Skills: React, JavaScript

Learn TypeScript (3 months)
    ↓
75% → Senior Frontend Dev ($90K in 6 months)
    ↓
Add Node.js (4 months)
    ↓
85% → Full-Stack Dev ($120K in 10 months)
    ↓
Add AWS (3 months)
    ↓
70% → Cloud Engineer ($140K in 13 months)
```

**Key Insight:** Small skill investments → Big career outcomes!

## 🎯 Current Implementation

### **Mock Data (Demo-Ready):**

Right now, the component uses smart mock data:

**4 Career Paths:**
1. Senior Frontend Developer (82% match)
2. Full-Stack Developer (68% match)
3. UI/UX Engineer (55% match)
4. Cloud Frontend Developer (60% match)

**Learning Roadmaps for Each Path:**
- Frontend: TypeScript → Advanced React → Testing (5 months)
- Full-Stack: Backend → Database → DevOps (9 months)
- UI/UX: Design Tools → Accessibility → Portfolio (7 months)
- Cloud: TypeScript → AWS → CI/CD (8 months)

**Resources Include:**
- TypeScript Handbook
- The Odin Project
- React Patterns
- Figma for Developers
- AWS Amplify
- ...and more

## 🚧 Ready for AI Integration

The component is **architecturally ready** for LangGraph:

### **Two Key Functions to Replace:**

1. **`generateCareerPaths()`** (Line 61)
   ```typescript
   // Current: Mock paths based on skill filtering
   // Next: Call LangGraph Career Simulator Agent
   const response = await fetch('/api/career-simulator/paths', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({ skills: currentSkills })
   });
   ```

2. **`generateLearningRoadmap(path)`** (Line 106)
   ```typescript
   // Current: Pre-defined roadmaps
   // Next: Call LangGraph Learning Path Agent
   const response = await fetch('/api/career-simulator/roadmap', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({ pathId: path.id, skills: currentSkills })
   });
   ```
