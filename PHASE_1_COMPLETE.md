## 📋 What Was Done

### Step 1.1: Remove Job Matcher Tab ✅
- Removed `JobMatcher` component import
- Removed "Job Matcher" tab from navigation
- Adjusted tab grid from `grid-cols-5` to `grid-cols-4`
- **Result:** Simplified navigation from 5 tabs to 4 tabs

### Step 1.2: Create Combined Learning & Career Tab ✅
- Created new component: `learning-and-career-tab.tsx`
- Merged "Learning Paths" and "Career Simulator" into single experience
- Updated dashboard navigation from 4 tabs to 3 tabs:
  1. **Skill Analysis** - Analyze GitHub repos/profiles
  2. **Learning & Career** - Career simulation + learning roadmap
  3. **Chat Assistant** - Context-aware AI chat

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### **Before (4 tabs, unclear journey):**
```
Skill Analysis → Learning Paths (separate)
                ↓
              Career (separate)
                ↓
              Job Matcher (removed)
```

### **After (3 tabs, clear journey):**
```
1. Skill Analysis
   ↓ (auto-navigate after analysis)
2. Learning & Career
   • See career paths → Select one → Get roadmap
   ↓
3. Chat Assistant
   • Ask questions, get guidance
```

## 💡 Butterfly Effect Integration

### **Inspired by Butterfly Tracker**

The career simulator uses the same probabilistic "butterfly effect" concept:

**Butterfly Tracker:**
```
Small marketing event → Viral outcomes (65% trending)
```

**SkillBridge:**
```
Small skill change → Career outcomes (75% Frontend Dev)
Learn TypeScript → 75% → Senior Frontend ($90K in 5 months)
              ↓
         Add Node.js → 85% → Full-Stack ($120K in 9 months)
              ↓
           Add AWS → 70% → Cloud Engineer ($140K in 12 months)
```

### **Unique Adaptations:**

1. **Probabilities** → Match scores based on current skills
2. **Outcomes** → Career paths with salary & timeline
3. **Simulation** → Real-time path generation
4. **Actionability** → Learning roadmaps for each path

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **New Component: `learning-and-career-tab.tsx`**

**Key Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface CareerPath {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  emoji: string;
  matchScore: number;         // 0-100 (like Butterfly Tracker probabilities)
  salaryRange: string;        // "$85K - $110K"
  timeline: string;           // "5 months"
  skillsYouHave: string[];
  skillsYouNeed: string[];
  demandLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  description: string;
}

interface LearningPhase {
  month: string;              // "Month 1-2"
  title: string;              // "TypeScript Mastery"
  skills: string[];
  resources: { name, url, type }[];
  milestone: string;
  completed?: boolean;
}
```

**Data Flow:**
```typescript
1. Component receives currentSkills from parent
2. generateCareerPaths() creates 3-5 paths
3. User clicks path → generateLearningRoadmap(path)
4. Roadmap displays with month-by-month plan
```
